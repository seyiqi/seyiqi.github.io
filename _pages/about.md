My research focuses on creating <b> label-efficient </b> and <b>explainable </b> deep learning models for medical imaging to improve clinical workflow and patient care.In particular, I am excited about exploring the following directions:
- <b> Multimodal learning</b>: How can we efficiently integrate information from different modalities (e.g. imaging, text, tabular data, sequential data) to better inform clinical decisions?
- <b> Explainable AI</b>: Can we enable computer aided diagnosis systems to explain their reasoning in a way that mimics how humans communicate?
- <b> Human-AI collaboration</b>: What is the optimal way to present an AI's diagnosis to clinicians so they can collaborate effectively to maximize patient outcomes?
 
I received my Ph.D. at the <a href='https://cds.nyu.edu/'> NYU Center for Data Science</a>, advised by <a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras/'> Prof. Krzysztof J. Geras</a> and <a href='https://kyunghyuncho.me/'> Prof. Kyunghyun Cho</a>. Prior to joining NYU, I worked at <a href='https://www.twosigma.com/'> Two Sigma Investments</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.rice.edu/'> Rice University</a>.

<b> Perspective students:</b> Starting in 2024, I'm looking for motivated Ph.D. students to join my team. Please check out <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQK3Kf0pwar6h3O0DpON5JsasvvJ0D8_bzDcg9mCdw0'> my advising statement</a> . I'm also open to collaborations with predoctoral researchers and visiting scholars. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email.
